How to create a project in Visual Studio 2008:
1. You would need:
	> Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 
	> Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.1
	> FlatRedBall August Release (No need for silverlight stuff)
	(May be you don't need FRB if you follow this readme, feel free to try it)

2. Once you have that, unzip the Klotski.zip in the ref folder.
3. Use the .sln file as your project.
4. Delete any existing reference to neoforce then add a reference to NeoForce dll in the lib folder.
